# Rust Rust Macro - Recoil Control System

Recoil control script built in Rust with ImGui for Rainbow Six Siege X

## Features

- **ACOG Toggle**: Separate recoil patterns for ACOG (2.5x)
- **Global Hotkeys**: Bind to default functions + wep selection
- **Ghost Mode**: Hide from Alt+Tab and screen capture
- **Auto-Sensitivity Scaling**: Automatically adjusts recoil values when sensitivity changes
- **Multiple Input Methods**: GFCK driver (universal) and GHub (Logitech only)
- **Add weapons**: If a weapon isn't already added you can add it

## Usage

1. Run rust-macro.exe
2. Select weapon
3. Configure X/Y recoil values (-2 to 2 for X, 1 to 10 for Y)
4. Enable RCS and test

## Configuration

- **X**: Horizontal recoil compensation
- **Y**: Vertical recoil compensation  
- **Xmod**: Special modifiers (-1 alternating, 0 one-time, 1 standard)
- **RPM**: Weapon rate of fire for timing calculations [(Fetch New Values Here)](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Weapons_of_Tom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six_Siege)

## Configuration Files

The application automatically creates and manages configuration files:

- `settings.ini`: Main configuration (sensitivity, DPI, weapon data)
- `hotkeys.ini`: Hotkey bindings
- Automatic backup and recovery system

## Advanced Features

### Auto-Sensitivity Scaling

When game sensitivity changes, the application automatically:

1. Detects sensitivity modification
2. Calculates scaling factor
3. Updates all weapon recoil values proportionally
4. Maintains relative weapon balance

### Ghost Mode

- Hide from Alt+Tab switcher
- Invisible to screen capture software
- Process name obfuscation
- Memory protection techniques

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**DLL Not Found**

- Ensure lib folder is in same directory as executable
- Check antivirus hasn't quarantined the files

**Hotkeys Not Working**

- Check for conflicting hotkeys with other applications
- Ensure hotkeys are properly bound in the Hotkeys tab

**Mouse Input Not Responding**

- Switch between GFCK and GhubMouse methods in Hotkeys tab
- GFCK is recommended for most users (default option)
- GhubMouse only works with compatible Logitech G-series mice
- Verify mouse drivers are properly installed
- Check DPI settings match your mouse configuration

**RCS Not Accurate**

- Verify game sensitivity matches Settings tab values
- Check DPI setting is correct
- Ensure weapon RPM values are accurate
- Test with different Xmod values
